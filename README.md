# Stream-Pi WIP Projects 

**Hello Everyone,

I will be going on a break for a week or two to prepare for college. That means that i will be out of the Stream-Pi Plugin making business for that time. So i will be releasing my WIP (Work in progress) plugins down below. If you want to poke around with the code or if you wanna try out these plugins, please let me know the outcome or any feedback you may have. BTW this doesn't mean every plugin will work. Only the plugins with the 'target' folder will be able to connect to stream-pi without issues.

THAT MEANS, if you wanna try any of these plugins, goto the plugin folder, then the target folder. After that, copy all jar files into the Stream-Pi Plugins folder. and DISCLAIMER: THESE PLUGINS ARE NOT TESTED OR ANYTHING, THEREFORE I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS

Thank you everyone for all the nice messages over my time here and can't wait for the future.

**Happy Holidays!
